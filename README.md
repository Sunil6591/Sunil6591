## 👤 About Me

I'm a senior technology leader with **20+ years** in software engineering, including **10+ years** building and scaling products in fast-paced startups. I specialize in **full-stack product engineering**, **AI/automation**, **cloud architecture**, and leading high-ownership engineering teams.

My focus is building lean, scalable, maintainable systems that solve real business problems — from modernizing legacy platforms to shipping new SaaS products end-to-end. I enjoy bridging tech + product, simplifying complexity, and enabling teams to deliver consistently through clean architecture and strong engineering culture.
